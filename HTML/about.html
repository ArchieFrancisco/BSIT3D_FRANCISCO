            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Archie Wendyll Francisco. I’m 20 years old, and I live in Camus Ext, Brgy Ibaba, Malabon City.
                 I’m currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at the City of Malabon University,
                  where I’m passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of technology and its innovations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of school, I like to unwind by playing online games like Wild Rift and Teamfight Tactics (TFT).
                 These games are not just fun for me—they also help me improve my strategic thinking and teamwork skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also an avid fan of manhwa and manga. I love diving into their incredible stories and appreciating the artistry
                 behind them. Reading these graphic novels sparks my creativity and keeps my imagination alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Balancing my hobbies with my studies helps me stay motivated and inspired,
                 and I believe these experiences will be vital as I work toward a successful career in IT.
            </p>
